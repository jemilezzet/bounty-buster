# bounty-buster

Bounty Buster is a marketplace for bounties. A user can post or complete tasks
with associated bounties. A poster can view his/her posted tasks and the submitted
requests for that task. The poster can accept or reject the requests. When a
request is accepted, the assigned bounty is sent to the requester.
